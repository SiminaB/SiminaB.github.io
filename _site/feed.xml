There are many resources for this. I am personally indebted to my Rafa Irizarry, Jeff Leek, Roger Peng, Karl Broman among others for many of these tips.
Note that I tend to spend maybe 90% of total analysis time doing this kind of EDA and don’t usually start doing much modeling until I do at least an initial first pass of EDA and discuss 
results with the rest of the team and/or investigators who generated the data/provided the samples. See also &lt;a href=&quot;http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science.png&quot;&gt;Hadley Wickham’s diagram&lt;/a&gt; representing the data analytic process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-tips&quot;&gt;General tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Science tip: Make sure you understand the study design. Sometimes things aren’t totally clear until after the EDA though. Are there
biological replicates, technical replicates, or both? What does “biological replicate” even mean? (Same person, different part of the tumor, but same date?
Same person, different time? Same person, one measurement before treatment and one measurement after treatment?) Make sure you have the variables
that will allow you to take the study design into consideration (eg may need a variable for “time point,” a variable for “individual” etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technical tip: If using R, always make sure you include NAs (for example, in the table function, this not the default - have to specify ‘useNA = “ifany”’)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;specific-steps&quot;&gt;Specific steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the number of samples, tabulate by all possible variables (such as case/control, disease type, sex, study site etc) - make sure there are no
NAs there, make sure variables are standardized (eg not have M = Male = male, breast cancer = Breast cancer = Neoplasm, breast)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider any crosstabulations that may make sense and may inform later analyses, for example case/control x study site, sex x SES, race x SES etc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the ranges of the data matrix/matrices. Make sure there are no NAs here. If there are, try to figure out why (eg clinical data may be missing, but
may aso have certain measurements above/below limit of detection, like in metabolomics or proteomics). Make sure that ranges all make sense (again, 0s
can indicate value below limit of detection - need to figure out what to do with this before applying log transforms; if study is on adolescents, make sure that no one
has age 1 or 30; make sure there are no weird codings for “missing data,” like 999 or -9 etc).  Do this using both tables of quantiles and histograms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have NAs or 0s for the omics dataset, get an idea of how prevalent these are. Are there some samples that are mostly NA/0? Are there some metabolites that are NA/0
in a large fraction of samples? I’ve used the cutoff of 5% before i.e. only use metabolites that are &amp;gt; 0 in 95% of the samples and for those samples, replace the 0s with the
smallest value above 0. That seems to work OK. If some metabolites are 0 in, say, 50% of the samples, you probably don’t want to use the (transformed) metabolite intensities
as outcomes in a linear regression and need to decide on a different model (this may be OK if the metabolite is caffeine or cotinine, which is present in smokers, for example - 
not all metabolites will be present in everyone, but if you see this for creatine or glucose, there may be an issue)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are clinical outcomes, make sure you understand them or how to calculate them. For example, if needed, make sure that you can calculate survival (so you have the appropriate dates and understand the censoring mechanism etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If anything has units, make sure you know what they are (eg is age in years or months?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you have data on batches or run order; if not, try to get those variables (for example, run dates for microarrays, run order
for metabolomics data)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make boxplots, PCA plots (use scale=TRUE if using prcomp, which is not the default) of log-transformed omics features, ordering and/or color-coding by the various
variables, especially batch/run order. This is probably the most important step in looking for possible artifacts/confounders. Note that even if there is no clear
confounding by batch/run order, there could still be confounding by other variables due to sample collection/processing &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the samples were actually run (for
example, if cases were collected in one hospital and controls in another hospital.) Some people like to do hierarchical clustering here, I personally prefer PCA plots. Make
sure the boxplots are before quantile normalization (QN), otherwise all the samples will all look the same (and we know that QN does not necessarily remove
batch effects and could actually make it worse). Clear shifts by batch can be bad in boxplots, but I’ve also seen cases where the median goes down and the variance
increases as the run order increases (so signal gets lower and messier) etc. Sometimes I’ll fit some regressions of PC1 and PC2 on the different variables - including
the batch/run order variables - to get a better idea of what’s going on, but I don’t think that’s always necessary.&lt;/li&gt;

presenting biostatistics or bioinformatics projects. There are many amazing resources out there. I internalized much
of the advice given to me by many awesome official and unofficial mentors (Jeff Leek, Giovanni
Parmigiani, Josh Sampson, Tom Louis, @theeffortreport with Roger Peng and Elizabeth Matsui, and
@NSSDeviations with Hilary Parker and Roger Peng, to list a few) and the goal here is to
pass some of it along to my students rather than to come up with a comprehensive list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My students tend to be from Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, so their projects involve both
scientific and statistical or computational aspects. This presents additional challenges,
given both the interdisciplinary nature of the work and the potential audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;major-guiding-principles&quot;&gt;Major guiding principles:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build the entire presentation by starting from the general scientific question you are trying 
to answer. Why are you studying this problem? Why is it interesting? Move from there into
the more technical aspects, but do so in a logical manner, still focusing on the
overall framework - Are you testing a specific hypothesis? Are you providing tools for exploratory
data analysis?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Know your audience: If statistical, you may need to introduce biology terms like the different kinds of mutations - e.g. missense, nonsense. If biomedical, do not assume knowledge of statistics past t-test or programming knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You should go into technical details only after you introduce the big picture/framework. For example,
details like “We use grouped LASSO with 10-fold crossvalidation” or “We used the following
10 packages in R” do not need to be introduced up front. Methods and tools are very important but they should
not be introduced without making it clear why you are doing so. Otherwise, you risk confusing people or making them
think that you are confusing an approach with the tool used to implement it (e.g. “we use the coxph command” instead
of “we fit a Cox proportional hazard model”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always assume your audience is intelligent and educated, but don’t be too worried about presenting things that
are too basic or “known by everyone,” especially in the first few slides (also see &lt;em&gt;Know your audience&lt;/em&gt; above - folks
will know much more about their own fields than about other fields.) This may either make people feel good that they
understand something or actually help them learn something new.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practice and iterate! Schedule practice presentations with your mentors and friends! 
Try not to take criticism personally during either the practice presentations (you want to improve!)
or during the actual presentation, although this can be hard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about things you really liked in some presentations you’ve seen and try to emulate them and also about things you really didn’t like
and try not to be that presenter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less can be more. Simplify, simplify, simplify! See below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;less-is-often-more&quot;&gt;Less is often more:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the iteration process, I try to always think about how to simplify everything and reduce the amount of text/talking. Maybe I’ll
come up with a simpler table with fewer columns or even replace a few bullet points with a diagram. Some specific advice on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t be the person who says: “I know you can’t really read this text, but it says…” If it’s not readable it’s too small.
If it’s too small it’s probably because you’re trying to cram too much in. Tables that are OK for reports/papers are usually
way too large to fit on slides or present in a way that keeps the audience engaged.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similarly, don’t have a 4x4 grid of plots but say “You only really need to focus on these 2 plots.” Only have those 2 plots then.
If you find that you’re not able to get into a specific plot due to time constraints, remove it.
Unless the plots are very closely related, it may be better to have them on separate slides.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The outline slide debate: Some people feel very strongly that you should have an outline slide, others that you should not.
I fall into the second camp, though I’m not totally dogmatic about this. I prefer to have a slide introducing the project and the 
overall goals, then go right into the presentation. Especially for a 15-20 minute presentation, you probably don’t want/need
to spend time on an outline slide where you say things like “I will start by introducing the problem,” “I will check the method
via simulations,” and definitely not “Finally, I will conclude with the conclusions.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try not to prepare more than one slide per minute (videos/demos are extra.) Be respectful of your audience’s time and try to 
do a good job conveying the gist of your work in the assigned time (ending a couple of minutes early is OK and way better than
ending 15 minutes late!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specific-advice-for-individual-slides&quot;&gt;Specific advice for individual slides:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give slides meaningful titles that are as self-contained as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t include large blocks of text and try not to have more than 3-4 bullet points.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try not to have many/any equations for a biomedical or mixed audience. I do usually have some when presenting
for a statistical audience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Label plots clearly and present them by first saying what the plot is assessing/presenting. This should 
also be in the slide/plot title. You not need a plot title if the slide title is specific enough. In fact, this 
will help you save on space and allow you to make things bigger/more readable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If using R to make the plots, change the x and y labels from the default variable names in R so that they’re more easily understandable. 
For example, you don’t want to distract the audience and spend extra time saying “Time.patient represents the overall survival time in weeks” - 
instead change that label to read “Overall survival time (in weeks).”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use large fonts and large labels on figures/tables (will probably need to increase font from defaults in R).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to use high-resolution figures. Projectors often make things fuzzier!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to be color-blind friendly by not using the red/green scheme. Colors can get messed up when projecting anyway, so
it may be better to use them sparingly and not have more than 3-4 different colors per plot. This depends a lot on your
application and may not always be possible, but again, think about where you can simplify!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not show a large number of significant digits. It is almost never necessary to show more than 2. The difference
between p = 1.9 x 10^-19 and p = 1.942529058202 x 10^-19 is very small and the latter is very distacting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-gotta-start-somewhere&quot;&gt;You gotta start somewhere!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you should consider the advice above, make sure it doesn’t give you writer’s block/analysis paralysis. I often
start out with a rough version by cutting/pasting from my manuscript/notes/R output, then think about how to focus it,
simplify it, and prettify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;practice-and-iterate-many-times&quot;&gt;Practice and iterate many times!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was already stated before, but cannot be overstated. It depends on the stage of your career and the type of talk as well,
of course (update to small group, final presentation for your degree, job interview etc), but in general it is very important.
Only by practicing can you see that you are belaboring some things or that certain plots/tables don’t fit in in their current form.
Make sure you give yourself enough lead time to be able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Below is a non-exhaustive list of recommendation on making presentation slides, focusing on presenting biostatistics or bioinformatics projects.
