      <div class="entry">
        <p>Since it’s close to the end of the year, I’m going to 
spend some time reflecting on it. One of the major challenges of a research career is that
there are often few concrete achievements and even when something good happens, it feels like
rejection is right around the corner. As a result, I decided at the very beginning of the year to keep
a running list of achievements, so that I could have something to cheer me up a bit in between the long
stretches of waiting. I wanted to include products that weren’t necessarily full-fledged papers,
including blog posts, talk acceptances, big grant submissions (not just acceptances, since those are way rare!)
This year did end up being really good in terms of paper acceptances and I think that
some of the smaller things allowed me to gain the extra confidence and ability to drive home
some bigger things.
Here is my list:</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>This is a non-exhaustive checklist of exploratory data analysis (EDA) checks I do for omics datasets + any associated demographic or meta-data, as a first step (after some basic reading in the data and basic preprocessing.)
There are many resources for this. I am personally indebted to my Rafa Irizarry, Jeff Leek, Roger Peng, Karl Broman among others for many of these tips.
Note that I tend to spend maybe 90% of total analysis time doing this kind of EDA and don’t usually start doing much modeling until I do at least an initial first pass of EDA and discuss 
results with the rest of the team and/or investigators who generated the data/provided the samples. See also <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science.png">Hadley Wickham’s diagram</a> representing the data analytic process.</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of recommendation on making presentation slides, focusing on 
presenting biostatistics or bioinformatics projects. There are many amazing resources out there. I internalized much
of the advice given to me by many awesome official and unofficial mentors (Jeff Leek, Giovanni
Parmigiani, Josh Sampson, Tom Louis, @theeffortreport with Roger Peng and Elizabeth Matsui, and
@NSSDeviations with Hilary Parker and Roger Peng, to list a few) and the goal here is to
pass some of it along to my students rather than to come up with a comprehensive list.</p>
