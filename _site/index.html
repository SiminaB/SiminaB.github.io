      <div class="entry">
        <p>This is a non-exhaustive checklist of exploratory data analysis (EDA) checks I do for omics datasets + any associated demographic or meta-data, as a first step (after some basic reading in the data and basic preprocessing.)
There are many resources for this. I am personally indebted to my Rafa Irizarry, Jeff Leek, Roger Peng, Karl Broman among others for many of these tips.
Note that I tend to spend maybe 90% of total analysis time doing this kind of EDA and don’t usually start doing much modeling until I do at least an initial first pass of EDA and discuss 
results with the rest of the team and/or investigators who generated the data/provided the samples. See also <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science.png">Hadley Wickham’s diagram</a> representing the data analytic process.</p>

        <p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of recommendation on making presentation slides, focusing on 
presenting biostatistics or bioinformatics projects. There are many amazing resources out there. I internalized much
of the advice given to me by many awesome official and unofficial mentors (Jeff Leek, Giovanni
Parmigiani, Josh Sampson, Tom Louis, @theeffortreport with Roger Peng and Elizabeth Matsui, and
@NSSDeviations with Hilary Parker and Roger Peng, to list a few) and the goal here is to
pass some of it along to my students rather than to come up with a comprehensive list.</p>
