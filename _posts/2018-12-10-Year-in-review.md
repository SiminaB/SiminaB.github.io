title:  "2018: Year in review"
---

This year has been a really good year workwise! I'm going to spend a bit of time towards the end of the year reflecting on it and maybe humblebragging a bit.
At the very beginning of the year, I decided that I would keep a running list of achievements, given the nature of research - basically, the fact that projects take
seemingly take forever and it often feels like one never gets anything done and rejection is always right around the corner. I wanted something to cheer me up a bit and also to include some products that
weren't necessarily full-fledged papers and seemingly more minor things like talk acceptances, big grant submissions (not just acceptances, since those are way rare!) 
etc. Here is my list:

* I had a tweet/blog post on regression that [kind of went viral](https://twitter.com/siminaboca/status/951201399563587589) Where viral = viral for me. I was really happy about this, since these were thoughts that
were swirling in my head since grad school and it was nice to get them out and also get a bit of validation by hearing how others actually found it useful
(January 10)
* I joined the ["deep review" project](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review) (collaboratively written paper reviewing deep learning in biomedical research). I don't actually work in deep learning but I like to think a lot
about how different methods should be applied and what their caveats are. It was a really awesome learning experience being on this kind of modern collaborative project and I'm really indebted to the [New PI Slack group]((https://twitter.com/NewPI_Slack).).
I had actually read a preprinted version of the paper and had a comment on an example that considered Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a disease that I have worked on before. I asked
[Casey Greene](https://twitter.com/GreeneScientist) about it and he encouraged me to go ahead and make the edits on GitHub. I ended up contributing enough to the new version to be listed as an author. (January 19)
