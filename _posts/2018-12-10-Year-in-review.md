title:  "2018: Year in review"
---

This year has been a really good year workwise! I'm going to spend a bit of time towards the end of the year reflecting on it and maybe humblebragging a bit.
At the very beginning of the year, I decided that I would keep a running list of achievements, given the nature of research - basically, the fact that projects take
seemingly take forever and it often feels like one never gets anything done and rejection is always right around the corner. I wanted something to cheer me up a bit in between the
endless waiting, including products that
weren't necessarily full-fledged papers and seemingly more minor things like talk acceptances, big grant submissions (not just acceptances, since those are way rare!) 
etc. Here is my list:

* I had a tweet/blog post on regression that [kind of went viral](https://twitter.com/siminaboca/status/951201399563587589) Where viral = viral for me. I was really happy about this, since these were thoughts that
were swirling in my head since grad school and it was nice to get them out and also get a bit of validation by hearing how others actually found it useful
(January 10)
* I joined the ["deep review" project](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review) (collaboratively written paper reviewing deep learning in biomedical research). I don't actually work in deep learning but I like to think a lot
about how different methods should be applied and what their caveats are. It was a really awesome learning experience being on this kind of modern collaborative project and I'm really indebted to the [New PI Slack (NPIS) group]((https://twitter.com/NewPI_Slack).).
I had actually read a preprinted version of the paper and had a comment on an example that considered Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a disease that I have worked on before. I asked
[Casey Greene](https://twitter.com/GreeneScientist) about it and he encouraged me to go ahead and make the edits on GitHub. I ended up contributing enough to the new version to be listed as an author. (January 19)
* My [commentary comparing biocuration to systematic reviews](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.17.00175) was accepted in JCO PO. I felt good about this since this was again something that I had been thinking about for a while now so I decided at some point last
year to just put my thoughts on paper. I had some general ideas so came up with a short draft, then recruited some other super knowledgeable folks to flesh out the details. This is the first time this kind of work has come
together for me. (January 19)
* By the end of February, I had alreadyhad 4 papers accepted (the "deep review," the commentary paper, 2 other collaborative papers.)
* I gave a talk a Brown University, invited by my friend, former NCI postdoc colleague, and coauthor Orestis Panagiotou. (April 10)
* Another paper that was accepted by JCO PO that I was a co-author on, considering an [eye-tracking study](http://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/PO.17.00296) for usability of molecular diagnostic reports. I was involved in the original study design and grant submission for it
and it was led by a former ICBI postdoc, Vishakha Sharma. It was also a really important project for the center and I was very happy to see it completed. (May 4)
* The supplement to my R21 grant was officially awarded! My R21 is funded through the [NCI Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program](https://nciphub.org/groups/itcr) and the supplement is for a collaboration with a group funded through the 
Innovative Molecular Analysis Technologies (IMAT) program. I had applied for it last year so kind of wondered whether it was "fair" to list it as an accomplishment for the year. Then I decided that I might as well. (May 21)
* I submitted an application for an [NIGMS R35 "MIRA" grant](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-17-190.html). I am again indebted to NPIS for finding out about this! It's a grant that is meant to fund early stage investigators' NIGMS-related research programs, 
as opposed to individual projects, which made it easier to write (for me at least!) than a regular project-driven grant. The chances of acceptance are always low for any individual grant, but I felt good just knowing that I could apply for this kind of big thing. If it doesn't get
funded, I will apply for sure next year as well! (September 28)
* By mid-October, I had 6 papers accepted (the ones mentioned above plus one more collaborative paper.)
* My paper with my former PhD adviser [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) on estimating false-discovery rates conditional on covariates was finally accepted by PeerJ. More on this paper below. For now - let me just say this was a very long process and it was such a relief to have it
officially out. (October 24)
