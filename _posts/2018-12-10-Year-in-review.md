title:  "2018: Year in review"
---

This year has been a really good year workwise! 
Since it's close to the end of the year, I'm going to spend a bit of time on it.
It may sound like I am humblebragging a bit and if it does, that is because I am:
At the very beginning of the year, I decided that I would keep a running list of achievements, given the nature of research - basically, the fact that projects take
seemingly take forever and it often feels like one never completes anything and rejection is always right around the corner. 
I specifically wanted something to cheer me up a bit in between the long stretches of waiting, so I included products that
weren't necessarily full-fledged papers and seemingly more minor things like talk acceptances, 
big grant submissions (not just acceptances, since those are way rare!) 
etc. Here is my list:

* I had a tweet/blog post on regression that [kind of went viral](https://twitter.com/siminaboca/status/951201399563587589) Where viral = viral for me. I was really happy about this, since these were thoughts that
were swirling in my head since grad school and it was nice to get them out and also get a bit of validation by hearing how others actually found it useful
(January 10)
* I joined the ["deep review" project](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review) (collaboratively written paper reviewing deep learning in biomedical research). I don't actually work in deep learning but I like to think a lot
about how different methods should be applied and what their caveats are. It was a really awesome learning experience being on this kind of modern collaborative project and I'm really indebted to the [New PI Slack (NPIS) group]((https://twitter.com/NewPI_Slack).).
I had actually read a preprinted version of the paper and had a comment on an example that considered Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a disease that I have worked on before. I asked
[Casey Greene](https://twitter.com/GreeneScientist) about it and he encouraged me to go ahead and make the edits on GitHub. I ended up contributing enough to the new version to be listed as an author. (January 19)
* My [commentary comparing biocuration to systematic reviews](http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.17.00175) was accepted in JCO PO. I felt good about this since this was again something that I had been thinking about for a while now so I decided at some point last
year to just put my thoughts on paper. I had some general ideas so came up with a short draft, then recruited some other super knowledgeable folks to flesh out the details. This is the first time this kind of project has come
together for me. (January 19)
* By the end of February, I already had 4 papers accepted (the "deep review," the commentary paper, 2 other collaborative papers.)
* I gave a talk a Brown University, invited by my friend, former NCI postdoc colleague, and coauthor Orestis Panagiotou. (April 10)
* Another paper that was accepted by JCO PO that I was a co-author on, considering an [eye-tracking study](http://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/PO.17.00296) for usability of molecular diagnostic reports. I was involved in the original study design and grant submission for it
and it was led by a former ICBI postdoc, Vishakha Sharma. It was also a really important project for the center and I was very happy to see it completed. (May 4)
* The supplement to my R21 grant was officially awarded! My R21 is funded through the [NCI Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program](https://nciphub.org/groups/itcr) and the supplement is for a collaboration with a group funded through the 
Innovative Molecular Analysis Technologies (IMAT) program. I had applied for it last year so kind of wondered whether it was "fair" to list it as an accomplishment for the year. Then I decided that I might as well. (May 21)
* I submitted an application for an [NIGMS R35 "MIRA" grant](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-17-190.html). I am again indebted to NPIS for finding out about this! It's a grant that is meant to fund early stage investigators' NIGMS-related research programs, 
as opposed to individual projects, which made it easier to write (for me at least!) than a regular project-driven grant. The chances of acceptance are always low for any individual grant, but I felt good just knowing that I could apply for this kind of big thing. If it doesn't get
funded, I will apply for sure next year as well! (September 28)
* By mid-October, I had 6 papers accepted (the ones mentioned above plus one more collaborative paper.)
* My paper with my former PhD adviser [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) on estimating the false-discovery rate (FDR) conditional on covariates was finally accepted by PeerJ. More on this paper below. For now - let me just say this was a very long process and it was such a relief to have it
officially out. (October 24)
* I got a talk accepted at the [CSHL Biological Data Science](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=DATA&year=18) meeting ([slides here](https://github.com/SiminaB/Presentations/blob/master/CSHL%20Bio%20Data%20Science%202018/Boca_CSHL.pdf)).
(notified on October 10, talk on November 9)
* I also got a talk accepted at the [AMIA 2019 Informatics Summit](https://www.amia.org/summit2019). (notified on October 30, conference will be in March 2019)
* I was also invited to give talks next year to the Breast Oncology Program at UCSF and the Bioconductor conference, which will be in New York.  (invited in November)
* I posted a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/23/475590) for metabolic biomarkers in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which I'm a co-first author on. (November 23)
* I read 8 books! Hoping to finish one more before the end of the year. They included books about science, like The Emperor of All Maladies, She Had her Mother's Laugh and The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, and book about time management and people management, like Deep
Work and 168 Hours.

As I said before, this has been a really good year! One thing that I wanted to note is this was definitely an exception in terms of the huge numbers of papers that have been accepted ("huge" for me, I know that there are many folks out there who are way more productive). 
However, most of the projects that were completed were things that I had started a long time ago. The FDR paper, for example, originated in an idea that Jeff had, based on some of my PhD work, that he wrote a [blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2013/06/13/false-discovery-rate-regression-cc-nsas-prism/) on... check out the date! June 13, 2013. Just for perspective, since
that time, I switched from being a postdoc at NCI to being faculty at [ICBI](https://icbi.georgetown.edu/), I had a second child, and 
[Simona Halep won the French Open](https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/44425403) 
(she reached her first Grand Slam final in 2014 and played two others before winning in 2018, all during the time it took for this paper to be completed). 
Of course, the work took a fair amount of time to complete,
but a large amount of time was also spent looking for a good home for the paper. In fact, we first posted a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/12/30/035675) of what's now a super outdated version of that project on December 30, 2015.
The great thing about posting it as a preprint was that it did get read a fair bit and even included in a [comparison](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/31/458786) of methods for FDR control, in which it was shown to have a good performance.

There were some other things that felt very satisfying because they were the result of seeds I had planted a while ago. For example, I had wanted to do more work in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, since my [2016](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153461) work on metabolic biomarkers for this disorder.
I kept asking collaborators about it until the right project came along. I really wanted to be able to present more at conferences/seminars and get both more talks when submitting abstracts and (any?) invited talks. 
So after whining about it for a while, I started asking around what the most appropriate conferences would be and also tried to put myself out there more, both when talking to friends and colleagues (including [Subha Madhavan](https://icbi.georgetown.edu/Madhavan), our center director, as well as NPIS),
as well as by being a bit more aggressive about self-advertising on Twitter.

That being said... If you notice, there was still that seemingly "empty" time between May and September when apparently nothing got done. I felt it acutely at the time too. I mean,
I'm sure I was doing _some_ things. I may well have been planting the seeds for some good things that will happen 2019-2023 (I certainly hope so!). 
I also got some reading done  during that time: I feel really good about the 8 books I've read; again, the number is surely low compared to many, but I've gone through years of
not being able to complete any books, so getting back on track feels very nice. In 2019 I want to be more
deliberate about planting seeds during these "dead periods" but also try to worry a bit less about them. After all, I also did things like take family vacations and really, I spend most of my 168 hours...
not doing work.
