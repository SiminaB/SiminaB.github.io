      <description>This is of course a bit of an exaggeration! It also depends on the way things are emphasized in, for example, statisticalgraduate programs. I know that my own training program was highly focused on seeing much of statistics as either aspecial case or a generalization of some kind of linear regression model. I kind of love this view and try to emphasize it whenever I canto collaborators, although I do admit that sometimes you have to start from special cases in order to build up the whole.</description>
